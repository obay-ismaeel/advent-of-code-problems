# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C#

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions. Here, I have documented my solutions for each day's challenge, all implemented in C#.


## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual series of holiday-themed puzzles that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are great for honing problem-solving skills and practicing programming.

In this repository, you will find my solutions for the 2023 problem set, all written in C#. Each solution is organized by day and includes both the problem statement and my approach to solving it.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:


Each day's folder contains:
- `program.cs`: The C# solution for the day's puzzle.
- `input.txt`: The input text of the day's problem.
